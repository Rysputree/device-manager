Test packet to the target imager. Like a ping, it acts as a heartbeat to the imager. A test packet is sent to the target imager, which then responds to it without any errors. We can also know the connection round-trip latency. We could also return the image from the last calibration.

Summary (TL;DR)

In this document, we provide major requirements for managing a single or a group of System 300 imaging systems. For the MVP, the focus is on the device management of a single imaging system. 

Device management refers to the processes, tools, and practices used to administer, operate, and maintain the deployed CTHz sensors. It involves monitoring network performance, diagnosing issues, configuring devices, managing security, and optimizing resource utilization.

Using this web-based application, users will be able to easily and rapidly configure, monitor, and troubleshoot a System 300. Related documents include:
MRD collated from the work done by the team as of 7/1/2025
PRD for the System 300
https://sourceforge.net/projects/onvifdm/



While the feature priorities will be targeted towards the MVP, the document captures three phases of the Device Management capabilities to meet customer requirements across various verticals. P0 features highlighted in yellow are mandatory for the MVP. 
Background

The Device Manager (DM) is critical to offering a “whole product” to our customers. This is the first application used to bring up, configure, monitor, visualize results, and troubleshoot the imaging system. Hence, it will set the tone for our entire solution in terms of usability, features, system integration, and integration with 3rd party applications used in overall Security Operations (SecOps). 

The DM is a web-based application hosted on the CTHz Sensor System 300. 

The overall requirements of the Device Manager can be broken down into the following functional groups.

Usage Model:


Connecting to the imager for the FIRST time
Via Ethernet cable to the imager
Using the default Wi-Fi network name (e.g., CTHz-Wi-Fi) and password

Turn on the Sensor System 300 and wait for a minute. Using a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox in that order), type your imager’s default IP address 192.168.1.10 or default Wi-Fi network. When prompted, enter the default login username and password. 

The device will NOT go into a scan mode unless and until the owner/admin account has been created and a new strong password is selected. 





Upon login, the user is taken to the HOME page for the device.

Comments
CFG-001
Configure imager information such as name, location, model number, date installed, date last updated, software version, hardware version, admin info incl login name & password, fps, etc. 
P0
Browser-based config for MVP. JSON or file-based approach ok for prototype. This assumes network access. 
CFG-002
Browser interface for configuration
P0
The user connects using the SSID and password for the imager. For the MVP, this can be a JSON script. 
CFG-003
Login screen with Welcome info
P0


CFG-004
Forgot Password
P1
For password recovery
CFG-005
Dynamic IP via DHCP (default)
DHCP On/Off
P0
For MVP, not mandatory
CFG-006
WiFi Radio On/Off
P0
Ability to turn on/off WiFi on the imager
CFG-007
Configure WiFi 
SSID, WPA2/3, Channel, etc.
Suppress SSID broadcast for enhanced security. Station mode is sufficient but will still have some WiFi configuration. Not ruling out our imagers creating a mesh in the future!
P0
Browser form captures all the info. Form has Save and Cancel buttons. 
CFG-007.1
GPS information
P1
Either through integrated GPS module or through the network information. 
CFG-008
Admin configuration
Username, password
P0
Suggestions only.  The config info can be changed and stored on the system in a secure manner. 
CFG-009
LAN Configuration (Static IP v4/v6)
IP Address, Subnet Mask, Default Gateway, Primary & Secondary DNS
P1
Suggestion only. Browser access is by default on port 80.
CFG-010
Bootup time target: 60 seconds. 
P1
Flexible for the MVP
CFG-011
Time Zone where the imager is located
P2


Copy approach, for example, used by Google Admin Console.
Select time zone based on geolocation (if available). 
CFG-012
Imager Status/Summary Tab
Provide full configuration summary info. Hardware type, software version, memory, storage, network info & status, self-test results, etc.
P0


CFG-013
Local storage server
name, IP Address, certificate or secure FTP credentials
P0
Mutual authentication with the local server prior to storing images and videos.  
CFG-013.1
Cloud storage integration for AWS, Azure, GCP
P1
Initially, local storage or the device or local server is sufficient. 
CFG-014
Heartbeat with local server. Default every 5 min. Configurable from 1 min to 5 min. 
P1
Periodic test packet embedding imager info. Not a Ping. Not mandatory for the MVP. 
CFG-015
NTP client configuration. Stratum 3 clock source is sufficient. We can use Google NTP server or find one at pool.ntp.org. Default sync time is one week. 604800 seconds
P0
Configure NTP client on the imager. The NTP server will be the clock source for system and video timing. Manual config OK for MVP. 
CFG-016
Configure optical imager to always capture visible video. 1080P plus Infrared plus night vision camera. 
P1
In the MVP, can use a separate video feed to sync time with CTHz synthetic video stream. 
CFG-016-1
Configure audio component of the video stream. Initially, targeting just the microphone for one-way audio; not two-way audio
P1
In certain situations, the audio provides additional information for forensic analysis or in understanding the real-time intent of any suspicious activities.  (Backup plan is to use the video stream from surveillance cameras.)
CFG-017
Configure CTHz 3D parameters such as FOV, ROI, FPS, etc.  
P0
1-2 fps may be sufficient for MVP. To be validated.
